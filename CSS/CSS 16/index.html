        <p class="small-note">This webpage was created to show my logo. I wanted to create something unique and something that has different meanings. The bear is combined with a pillow to show sleep but the colors speak of the outdoors.</p>
        <h3>Here is some of the thinking that went into this logo design:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>With my logo I used a few tools on Illustrator. I used the shape tool to create all of the circle and squares. I used the anchor point tool to curve the edges of the rectangle for the pillow shape. I used the pen tool to add extra anchor points to bend down the pillow to create the shape of the bear. Lastly I used a lot of guides to line up all of the shapes together.</li>
          <li>The colors I chose to reflect the outdoors. I have a dark teal/green color that you would see on tress. I choose a dark brink color that appears brown compliments the teal of the trees.</li>
          <li>My logo would appeal to outdoors people, especially for their children. They know they can buy camping gear that will be cute and use for their kids. It can work well on apparel for kids but you can also put it on sleeping bags blankets or other sleeping gear for the outdoors.</li>
          <li>I used quite a few design skills to create this logo. The nose I choose, is a focal point. The dark noses stands strong against the light background that creates contrast. Everything is lined up to create balance and equilibrium. The typography is fun and plays with the fun feel of the logo.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small-note">The logo process description needs to be at least 200 words. Include all of the above elements, plus any other pertinent information.</p>
